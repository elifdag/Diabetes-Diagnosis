### Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Python libraries I used are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

### Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
Confusion Matrix: A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
ROC Curve: A plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate
